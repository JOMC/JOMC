/**
 * Hash-table based {@code Map} implementation with weak keys, using
 * object-identity in place of object-equality when comparing keys.
 *
 * <p>In a {@code WeakIdentityHashMap} two keys {@code k1} and {@code k2} are
 * considered equal if and only if {@code k1==k2} evaluates to {@code true}.
 * An entry will automatically be removed when its key is no longer in ordinary
 * use. More precisely, the presence of a mapping for a given key will not
 * prevent the key from being discarded by the garbage collector, that is, made
 * finalizable, finalized, and then reclaimed. When a key has been discarded its
 * entry is effectively removed from the map, so this class behaves somewhat
 * differently from other {@code Map} implementations and is not a
 * general-purpose {@code Map} implementation! Although it implements the
 * {@code Map} interface, it intentionally violates {@code Map}'s general
 * contract, which mandates the use of the {@code equals} method when comparing
 * objects.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class has performance characteristics similar to those of the
 * {@code HashMap} class, and has the same efficiency parameters of
 * {@code initialCapacity} and {@code loadFactor}. All of the optional map
 * operations are provided. It does not support {@code null} values and the
 * {@code null} key. All methods taking a key or value will throw a
 * {@code NullPointerException} when given a {@code null} reference. No
 * guarantees are made as to the order of the map; in particular, there is no
 * guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. Like most collection
 * classes, this class is not synchronized. A synchronized
 * {@code WeakIdentityHashMap} may be constructed using the
 * {@code Collections.synchronizedMap} method.</p>
 *
 * <p>The behavior of the {@code WeakIdentityHashMap} class depends in part upon
 * the actions of the garbage collector, so several {@code Map} invariants do
 * not hold for this class. Because the garbage collector may discard keys at
 * any time, a {@code WeakIdentityHashMap} may behave as though an unknown
 * thread is silently removing entries. In particular, even if synchronizing on
 * a {@code WeakIdentityHashMap} instance and invoking none of its mutator
 * methods, it is possible for the {@code size} method to return smaller values
 * over time, for the {@code isEmpty} method to return {@code false} and then
 * {@code true}, for the {@code containsKey} method to return {@code true} and
 * later {@code false} for a given key, for the {@code get} method to return a
 * value for a given key but later return {@code null}, for the {@code put}
 * method to return {@code null} and the {@code remove} method to return
 * {@code false} for a key that previously appeared to be in the map, and
 * for successive examinations of the key set, the value collection, and
 * the entry set to yield successively smaller numbers of elements. To protect
 * against such situations all {@code Iterator}s and {@code Entry}s created by
 * this class throw an {@code IllegalStateException} when a key becomes
 * {@code null} or a mapping got removed.</p>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by the {@code iterator} method of the collections
 * returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are
 * fail-fast: if the map is structurally modified at any time after the iterator
 * is created, in any way except through the iterator's own {@code remove}
 * method, the iterator will throw a {@code ConcurrentModificationException}.
 * Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it
 * is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators throw
 * {@code ConcurrentModificationException}s on a best-effort basis. Therefore,
 * it would be wrong to write a program that depends on this exception for its
 * correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to
 * detect bugs.</i></p>
